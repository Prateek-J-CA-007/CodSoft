During my internship at Codsoft, I gained hands-on experience with various stages of data science project workflows. 
I worked extensively on data loading, inspection, and cleaning, where I prepared datasets for meaningful analysis. 
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered patterns and insights that helped guide model building tailored to the specific nature of each dataset.
I developed, tested, and evaluated models to ensure reliable predictions, using visualization techniques to make the results accessible and actionable. 
This experience strengthened my practical skills in handling real-world data science tasks end-to-end.

Projects Name with discriptions-

Project 1- CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
details -- -> Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit cardtransactions. 
           ->Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
           ->Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
           ->Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling orundersampling for improving results.


Project 2- SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Details --->   -> Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such asadvertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
                  advertising platform selection.
               -> In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machinelearning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, 
                  allowingthem to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. 
               -> By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.


Project 3- MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
Details --->   -> Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based onfeatures like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.
               -> The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a modelthat accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users orcritics.
               -> Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore dataanalysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. 
               -> It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
